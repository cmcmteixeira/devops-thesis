			Lead Dev(Imaginary Cloud)




Patterns
--------
	Concepts
	--------
		Version Control
		---------------
			Tudo usa git

		Testing
		-------
			11 tem Unit Tests
			4 tem integration tests

		CI
		--
			CI so existe associado a testes
		
		Team Management
		---------------
			Agile(generally adapted)
			Almost always divided by speciality
			Teams from 1 to 9 max (generally between 4 and 6)
			Almost always self organized

		Communication
		-------------
			Direct contact prefered
			Chat tool available(for links and files)
			Chat's sometimes have integration w/ tools like(CI)
		

		Deployment
		----------
			7 have automatic deploys configured(not CD)
			None has a CD platform(there is always a manual check before deploying)
			4 Use the provider Database system(Those that don't have a very specific reason to do so)


		Infrastructure
		--------------
			Scaling is usually managed by the provider(mostly manual triggered)
			Not many companies use it thtough

		Jobs(Tasks)
		----
			Launching new infrastrucure(2)
			Having a worker() -> 



	Patterns
	--------
		Microservicos(6)-> IaaS or PaaS(5) :
		
		CI(7)  			-> Unitary Tests(7) :
		CI(7)			-> Run tests on push (alguns fazem polling para manter server de CI offline) 

		Int. Tests(3)	-> Unit.Tests(3) :  
		
		No separated Departs.

		Code reviews(3) -> Technical Owner(2)
			(Only if tests pass, on pull request)

		Self-Scaling I.S(4) -> Use Provider managed DB(3)
