\section{Context} \label{chap:introduction:section:context}

	As the internet grew and more people joined, an ever increasing number of
businesses and opportunities started to emerge.
	
    Initially, businesses that wanted to provide services over the internet would need to buy servers, hire operations crews and buy real estate to accommodate the previous two. Additionally, businesses were also subjected to large usage fluctuations. This meant that a lot of the time, servers and teams were not being used in an optimal way. 
    
    Large upfront costs combined with large maintenance costs and unused resources were obviously not desirable and eventually solutions to this problems started to appear. Eventually named ”cloud computing”, the solution consisted in a new type of business that allowed other businesses to rent computing resources with little to no upfront costs. Cloud computing providers would charge businesses based on the usage as well as allow them to quickly increase or decrease computing resources. This elasticity combined with the elimination of the previously mentioned upfront costs meant that more businesses could be born and that the existing ones could lower their operational costs.

	In the midst of this change a new set of opportunities and problems started to arise. This ideas and problems eventually started the denominated DevOps movement. This movement called for the end of organizational boundaries between operations and development departments, integration of the previous two and the automation of repetitive tasks. This way DevOps aimed to reduce software time to market, teams sizes and also increase businesses agility and efficiency.	

\section{Problem} \label{chap:problem:section:context}

As stated in \ref{devops:challenges} DevOps knowledge and practices are still not well defined. Additionally, it is also stated that there are still companies that fail to correctly adopt DevOps. 

        
\section{Motivation \& Objectives} \label{chap:problem:section:motivation}

        This work aims to provide companies and teams that want to adopt DevOps knowledge relative to DevOps and the adoption process. This information should be easy to access and understand and, it should allow companies to have a feeling of the effort needed to adopt DevOps as well as allow them to define a preliminary road map for the adoption. 
        
        Lastly with the information provided, companies must be able to solve most of the problems that will appear when adopting DevOps.
