\chapter*{Abstract}

The Internet is a constantly evolving space with millions of users and untapped opportunities. 

In order for businesses and companies to successfully conduct their operations in the Internet, new organizational patterns and procedures have appeared and evolved. This processes and organization patterns aim to answer the difficulties of handling the volatility and the complexity of this space.

Eventually culminating in the DevOps movement, this changes have been gaining adopters in the industry and showing promising results.

Contrary to what would be expected, based on some of the results and the number of adopters, this new movement has not yet seen substantial investigation or formalization. 

This lack of information is often responsible for the failure of new adopters that are forced, along the way, to learn how to overcome the different obstacles and challenges associated with the adoption of DevOps.

To reduce both the chances of failure and time of adoption it is important to  empower businesses with enough information about this subject as possible.

By studying the Portuguese Startup Scene and extracting valuable information about solutions and challenges identified while adopting DevOps this thesis intends to do just that.

This gathered information is expected to be compiled in a organized and structured way in order to allow businesses to have a better understanding of both the DevOps movement and the adoption process.
