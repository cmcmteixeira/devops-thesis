\chapter*{Abstract}

Formed by combining the word Development with the word Operations, DevOps has been around for sometime. Uses and appearances of the word have been seen in different contexts and with different meanings making it a topic of discussion and discord. 

For some, DevOps is a movement aiming to conciliate Operations and Developers, others believe that its just a set of tools that help automate operations tasks and procedures and others see it as a job or tittle for professionals that combine developer and operations skills.

In this thesis we demystify DevOps by reviewing what has been written about DevOps and by looking at some of the organizations that practice it.

The end result is a set of observed patterns and compiled information regarding DevOps and its implementation.
