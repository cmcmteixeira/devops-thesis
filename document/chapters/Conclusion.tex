\chapter{ Conclusion } \label{chap:conclusion}

 As a result of the vastness of areas that the DevOps movement touches, there is a feeling that more research work has to be done in regards to understanding technologies and practices related to DevOps before advancing to the next phase. 
 
 Nevertheless the current work allows us to be confident in a good final result. Additionally the lack of information regarding the current state of DevOps and its practices is a good motivator in the sense that studying DevOps seems to be both useful and innovative.
