\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:introduction}
DevOps ideas are not recent (DevOps ideals can be traced back as far as 2008) but neverthless, academic and peer reviewed literature about the subject is scarce.

Having notice that, we aim, in this thesis, to study DevOps and the way it is being applied. With this study, we aim to enable those that want to adopt DevOps and those who want to study DevOps with a starting point on which to build.

		\section{Context} \label{chap:introduction:sec:context}
		Developing and maintaining/operating software are often disjoint tasks and responsabilities. This pattern has been observed in several organizations and project management techniques. Nevertheless, this was not always the case, and, in the beginning, the same person that developed the software was also the person that operated it \cite{Loukides2012}.

		As a result of this separation, two separated departments were born. This two departments, Development and Operations, would not be able to efficiently articulate preventing businesses from beeing as efficient as they could be.

		Devops appeared within this context with the objective of solving this lack of articulation between those that developed and those that maintained/operated.

		\section{Problem} \label{chap:introduction:sec:problem}

		The DevOps movement spans throughout a vast set of areas and tries to change both the technical and cultural aspects related with software development and with the software delivery pipeline.

		Looking at the current state of DevOps, we can see that the movement popularity was and is rising. We can find, with a simple google search, numerous blog posts about experiences and opinions regarding Devops an its adoption. Not only that, but there are also a growing number of \textit{Devops ready} tools that promise to simplify and empower companies with the benefits of Devops.

		Contrastingly, a simmilar search on \textit{Scopus} will yield close to 200 results which is a much smaller list of results when compared with other terms like \textit{SCRUM} (more than 2000 results) or \textit{Waterfall} (more than 700 results).

		This lack of academic literature and study means that Devops understandment is still mostly based on opinions and personal experiences rather than scientific, peer reviewd literature. Consequently, adopting and practicing DevOps is still a surounded with uncertainties.

		\section{Motivation} \label{chap:introduction:sec:motivation}

		Devops represents a new way to look at the entire software pipeline. From development to delivery and maintenance, Devops represents an advantage for both teams and businesses by creating a more efficient, agile and collaborative way of working. DevOps also reduces the software time to market which provides a competitive advantage for those that are able to practice it.

		With that in mind, we believed that studying Devops, its values and common practices, will enable broader adoption further strengthening the movement and both practicioners and businesses.

		\section{Goals}
		The main goal of this thesis is to increase the existent knowledge regarding DevOps. With this increment, teams and companies that want to adopt DevOps will be able to better understand common pitfalls and solutions related with DevOps. At the same time, further studies of the DevOps movement will be able to build upon this study by extending the current concepts or by having a base from which to search new ones.
