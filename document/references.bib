The duration of product design, development, and support was predictable enough that companies and their employees scheduled their finances, vacations, surgeries, and mergers around product releases. When developers were busy, quality assurance (QA) had it easy. As the coding portion of a release cycle came to a close, QA took over while support ramped up. Then when the product released, the development staff exhaled, rested, and started the loop again while the support staff transitioned to busily supporting the new product.},

Application developers can focus on business and functionality and leverage infrastructure clouds (IaaS) to provide them low cost resources (e.g., computation, storage, and networking) that can be controlled based on application needs. However, current IaaS cloud developers have to deal with daunting tasks to configure and deploy their applications in different cloud providers. This paper presents the Uni4Cloud approach that facilitates to model, deploy and configure complex applications in multiple infrastructure clouds. We demonstrate through an enterprise application case study how Uni4Cloud facilitates to deploy components (e.g., application server, database, load balancer) in multiple clouds using a model-based approach that helps to automatically configure and deploy applications independent of IaaS cloud provider. Moreover, the approach is based on cloud computing standards such as the Open Virtualization Format (OVF) and Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) to favor interoperability and to avoid being locked in to specific cloud providers.},

abstract = {DevOps is an emerging paradigm to tightly integrate developers with operations personnel. This is required to enable fast and frequent releases in the sense of continuously delivering software. Users and customers of today's Web applications and mobile apps running in the Cloud expect fast feedback to problems and feature requests. Thus, it is a critical competitive advantage to be able to respond quickly. Beside cultural and organizational changes that are necessary to implement DevOps in practice, tooling is required to implement end-to-end automation of deployment processes. Automation is the key to efficient collaboration and tight integration between development and operations. The DevOps community is constantly pushing new approaches, tools, and open-source artifacts to implement such automated processes. However, as all these proprietary and heterogeneous DevOps automation approaches differ from each other, it is hard to integrate and combine them to deploy applications in the Cloud. In this paper we present a systematic classification of DevOps artifacts and show how different kinds of artifacts can be transformed toward TOSCA, an emerging standard in this field. This enables the seamless and interoperable orchestration of arbitrary artifacts to model and deploy application topologies. We validate the presented approach by a prototype implementation, show its practical feasibility by a detailed case study, and evaluate its performance.},

abstract = {Computing as you know it is about to change, your applications and documents are going to move from the desktop into the cloud. I'm talking about cloud computing, where applications and files are hosted on a "cloud" consisting of thousands of computers and servers, all linked together and accessible via the Internet. With cloud computing, everything you do is now web based instead of being desktop based. You can access all your programs and documents from any computer that's connected to the Internet. How will cloud computing change the way you work? For one thing, you're no longer tied to a single computer. You can take your work anywhere because it's always accessible via the web. In addition, cloud computing facilitates group collaboration, as all group members can access the same programs and documents from wherever they happen to be located. Cloud computing might sound far-fetched, but chances are you're already using some cloud applications. If you're using a web-based email program, such as Gmail or Hotmail, you're computing in the cloud. If you're using a web-based application such as Google Calendar or Apple Mobile Me, you're computing in the cloud. If you're using a file- or photo-sharing site, such as Flickr or Picasa Web Albums, you're computing in the cloud. It's the technology of the future, available to use today.},

abstract = {Cloud computing promises a radical shift in the provisioning of computing resources within the enterprise. This paper describes the challenges that decision makers face when assessing the feasibility of the adoption of cloud computing in their organizations, and describes our Cloud Adoption Toolkit, which has been developed to support this process. The toolkit provides a framework to support decision makers in identifying their concerns, and matching these concerns to appropriate tools/techniques that can be used to address them. Cost Modeling is the most mature tool in the toolkit, and this paper shows its effectiveness by demonstrating how practitioners can use it to examine the costs of deploying their IT systems on the cloud. The Cost Modeling tool is evaluated using a case study of an organization that is considering the migration of some of its IT systems to the cloud. The case study shows that running systems on the cloud using a traditional ‘always on’ approach can be less cost effective, and the elastic nature of the cloud has to be used to reduce costs. Therefore, decision makers have to model the variations in resource usage and their systems’ deployment options to obtain accurate cost estimates.},

Old-style system administrators may be disappearing in the face of automation and cloud computing, but operations have become more significant than ever. As this O’Reilly Radar Report explains, we’re moving into a more complex arrangement known as "DevOps."Mike Loukides, O’Reilly’s VP of Content Strategy, provides an incisive look into this new world of operations, where IT specialists are becoming part of the development team. In an environment with thousands of servers, these specialists now write the code that maintains the infrastructure. Even applications that run in the cloud have to be resilient and fault tolerant, need to be monitored, and must adjust to huge swings in load. That was underscored by Amazon’s EBS outage last year.From the discussions at O’Reilly’s Velocity Conference, it’s evident that many operations specialists are quickly adapting to the DevOps reality. But as a whole, the industry has just scratched the surface. This report tells you why.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The First Complete Guide to DevOps for Software Architects DevOps promises to accelerate the release of new software features and improve monitoring of systems in production, but its crucial implications for software architects and architecture are often ignored. In DevOps: A Software Architect’s Perspective, three leading architects address these issues head-on. The authors review decisions software architects must make in order to achieve DevOps’ goals and clarify how other DevOps participants are likely to impact the architect’s work. They also provide the organizational, technical, and operational context needed to deploy DevOps more efficiently, and review DevOps’ impact on each development phase. The authors address cross-cutting concerns that link multiple functions, offering practical insights into compliance, performance, reliability, repeatability, and security. This guide demonstrates the authors’ ideas in action with three real-world case studies: datacenter replication for business continuity, management of a continuous deployment pipeline, and migration to a microservice architecture. Comprehensive coverage includes • Why DevOps can require major changes in both system architecture and IT roles • How virtualization and the cloud can enable DevOps practices • Integrating operations and its service lifecycle into DevOps • Designing new systems to work well with DevOps practices • Integrating DevOps with agile methods and TDD • Handling failure detection, upgrade planning, and other key issues • Managing consistency issues arising from DevOps’ independent deployment models • Integrating security controls, roles, and audits into DevOps • Preparing a business plan for DevOps adoption, rollout, and measurement},

abstract = {DevOps for Developers delivers a practical, thorough introduction to approaches, processes and tools to foster collaboration between software development and operations. Efforts of Agile software development often end at the transition phase from development to operations. This book covers the delivery of software, this means “the last mile”, with lean practices for shipping the software to production and making it available to the end users, together with the integration of operations with earlier project phases (elaboration, construction, transition). DevOps for Developers describes how to streamline the software delivery process and improve the cycle time (that is the time from inception to delivery). It will enable you to deliver software faster, in better quality and more aligned with individual requirements and basic conditions. And above all, work that is aligned with the “DevOps” approach makes even more fun!},

@book{Fallis2013,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Over the past 15 years the ICT revolution has driven global development in an unprecedented way. Technological progress, infrastructure deployment, and falling prices have brought unexpected growth in ICT access and connectivity to billions of people around the world. In 2015 there are more than 7 billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide, up from less than 1 billion in 2000. Globally 3.2 billion people are using the Internet of which 2 billion are from developing countries. ICTs will play an even more significant role in the post 2015 development agenda and in achieving future sustainable development goals as the world moves faster and faster towards a digital society. Our mission is to connect everyone and to create a truly inclusive information society, for which we need comparable and high-quality data and statistics to measure progress.”},

Due to the tremendous demand and necessity, researchers went beyond connecting just computers into the web. These researches led to the birth of a sensational gizmo, Internet of Things (IoT). Communication over the internet has grown from user - user interaction to device - device interactions these days. The IoT concepts were proposed years back but still it's in the initial stage of commercial deployment. Home automation industry and transportation industries are seeing rapid growth with IoT. Yet not many articles have been published in this field of study. This paper aims in structuring a state of the art review on IoT. The technology, history and applications have been discussed briefly along with various statistics.},
