	Dev

		After each commit integration and unit tests are run, if a test fails the person who commited the code is notified(the continuous integration manager(team city) handles this) and a message is displayed in the team chat tool.
	Done
		When in done a feature is checked by a QA and the PO that check the design and functionality of the feature.

Deployment is done manually(in case of the web infrastructure) and automatically(the application can auto update itself.)

Infrastructure
--------------
Infrastructure management at abyssal is mostly done manually due to the fact that the load and user numbers upper bounds are well defined.
Abyssal infrastructures is hosted in AWS(IaaS for software,SaaS for databases). Databases are managed by the provider.
