TOPDOX is currently developing a platform that allows users to view/edit/manage documents in different formats and from different cloud providers in a single app. 
Currently the company has around 200 000 users from several countries.
In order to manage the work needed the team uses a Kanban board in Trello.

TOPDOX has currently 5 mobile apps being developed at the same time alongsied a web app and an backend API. Teams are organized according to the app they are developing for and rotation between areas is encouraged. Team sizes range from 1 to 3 people and they are made up of developers.

TOPDOX pipeline is different for each project being developed. The pipeline analysed here is the one relative to the backend api. 

The first state is when a feature is finished by the developer. In this state, features are expected to work and be tested by the developer that implemented them. 

After the first stage, another team member is supposed to review the feature implementation and if it is considered ok acept it in the development branch. 

An integration in the staging environment is then automatically done using jenkins and if everithing is working the feature is pushed to production.

The deploymenet project consists in pushing for each of the live servers (each server has a git server running) the new code. After each push pm2 ( a node.js process manager) restarts the server.

The live servers are hosted in the Azure Platform and load balancing is managed by the platform. 

Databases are maintained in different machines.

In order to monitor the live servers the team uses New Relic and manually checks the logs present in the machine from time to time.
