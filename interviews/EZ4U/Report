EZ4U currently has a solution that enables companies the sending of sms using either an API or an application interface.
The service is structured in 3 different layers, an UI layer, an API layer  and a layer that then communicates with the mobile operators

Requests and sms are stored to be sent and daemons gradually send them.

The team is currently composed of 2 elements. Both share the development and develop the unitary tests.

Development is done directly in the AWS cloud platform in order to approximate further the development environment of the production environment.

The software pipeline has 3 stages:
	Under Development

	Testing
		Both the development team and the sales team use the product.
	Production

Transition between the steps is done manually by connecting to the servers.

Infrastructure is hosted in AWS and the infrastructure is prepared to handle the worst case scenario. The tools for monitoring are provided by the cloud provider. Nevertheless a proprietary meachanism is monitoring the sms sending speed and if it detects changes in this speed actions are taken by this mechanism.
