Hypelabs is currently developing a software framework designed to allow mobile devices to communicate in a shared network. The project is roughly 1 year old and is currently in developing phase.There are currently 7 employees.
Hypelabs employees are all developers and organize ther workload using Post-it's in the wall. Features and problems are analysed and assigned by the team and features are organized in branches in a way similar to the gitflow ( one branch for each feature that is merged in a master branch ).

The team communicates using Facebook or Slack.

Tests are done manually and the responsibility of assuring the correct behaviour of the each feature falls to the people that made it.

Given the nature of the product and the phase in wich the company is in, Hypelabs doesn't have a well defined pipeline, nevertheless, feature implementation follows the following states:

	
	State of the art
		A state of the art relative to the feature being implemented is drafted
	Implementation Proposal
		A proposal, based on the state of the art, is made for the implementation of the feature
	Team Discussion
		The team discusses the proposal and if accepted the feature is implemented
	Implementation
