Report: 

Arealytics is a young company ( 5 month old in the time this interveiw as conducted) that wants to transform CCTV and other types of cameras into analytics tools. In order to do this, Arealytics developed a web platform that analises camera footage and tracks user movements throughout a store as well as interactions with displayed products.

Arealytics had at the date of this interview two members. Both members had previous software backgrounds ( Electrotechnical Engineering ) and were developing the initial product.
The product consisted in a web platform written in PHP(backend) and Javascript(frontend) that worked as a dashboard and displayed the treated/analysed data from the cameras. The interface with the cameras was established using the cloud/webservices.

Because of it's tender age and small size, Arealytics didn't feel the need to invest in a well defined pipeline and therefore there was only one environment: development environment. 
No automation mechanisms were indentified during the interview. 

In order to manage the workload and tasks the Arealytics used Asana(a TODO like tool) and members communicated using Slack. The version control system used was GIT. 

Tests were unexistent but Miguel(one of the team members of Arealytics) demonstrated interest in implementing them.
